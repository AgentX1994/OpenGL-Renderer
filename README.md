Open GL Renderer V0.1

  This is a basic mesh renderer written in C++ using OpenGL with [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/). Currently, it only supports one mesh (a basic cube) and single color shading, and the camera can only translate, not rotate.
  
  Controls:
  W,S - Forwards, Backwards
  A,D - Left, Right
  R,F - Up, Down
  
  TODO (In rough order of desired completion):
  * Add support for camera rotation using the mouse
  * Add support for surface normals on meshes for more advanced shading
  * Add support for point light sources
  * Add support for loading in arbitrary meshes
  * Add support for adding objects during execution
  * Add support for removing objects during execution
  * Add support for saving/loading scenes
  * More to be determined
